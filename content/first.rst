So, in preparation of the first article on this site, while experimenting with the `Apricot theme <https://github.com/lbarchive/apricot/tree/c31af614fdd7c9fb311ac0df85f835ad6ad40530>`_, I literally `rm -rf` 'd the website. I wasn't content with the how the theme displayed some elements. Perhaps I experimented **too much**...

The *first* article was supposed to be about how I wanted to write blogs and my acceptance into the :abbr:`GSoC (Google Summer of Code)` program. I wrote how I selected my organization for the program - `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_. How I had been using Inkscape for almost two and a half years when applying and how much I loved Inkscape (still ‚ù§Ô∏è it). Inkscape is a vector graphics editing program :abbr:`btw (By the Way)`. I also wrote about selecting the :abbr:`SSG (Static Site Generator)` for this website and learning to use the :abbr:`rSt (reStructuredText)` markup format.

The last paragraph above now shall serve as the meta-article for the original first one.

Anyways, now I know better than to mindlessly `rm` things. The importance of local backups is also highlighted.üòå

That's all I have to say for now, adieu...
